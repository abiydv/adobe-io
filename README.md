# Adobe I/O Cloud Manager Integration

Deploy this API Gateway + Lambda in your AWS account to get notified of executions on Adobe Cloudmanager. Notifications will be sent to both email, and MS Teams.

This can be extended to implement more functionalities like auto-approve, auto-reject pending executions etc.

Deploying this stack will create a new api endpoint, which needs to be added to the Adobe I/O console to complete the setup.
